# Vaishnavi Nichal — Portfolio (Tailwind CDN + Node/Express)

This is a minimal developer portfolio using Tailwind via CDN for quick demo and Node/Express as a static server.

## How to run locally

1. Install dependencies:
   npm install

2. Start the server:
   npm start

3. Open http://localhost:3000

## Deploying live (Render / Heroku / Railway)
- Push this repo to GitHub.
- Connect the repository to Render (or Railway/Heroku).
- For Render: create a new Web Service, use 'npm start' as the start command.
- Ensure PORT is read from environment (server.js does this).
